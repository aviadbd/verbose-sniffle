A Day in Fujikawaguchiko: Exploring Nature and History

As I woke up in my cozy room in Fujikawaguchiko, I realized that it was a freezing morning. The temperature outside and inside was -6 degrees Celsius, which made it almost impossible to get out of bed. However, I learned a valuable lesson: turn on the air conditioner on freezing nights all night.

After some coffee and a quick breakfast, my friend and I set off to explore the area. We planned to ask some questions about the journey to Kyoto, but we almost missed the bus to the hiking area. We barely made it on time, quickly grabbed some food, and headed towards Mount Kamenshi.

Unfortunately, the route was closed, and we soon discovered that there was no other way to continue without passing through a "no entrance" area. We decided to give up and walked towards the second mountain, Junigatka. On the way, we had a pleasant walk around Lake Saiko, which offered stunning views of the mountains and the hidden Mount Fuji.

When we finally reached the second mountain, we realized that the route was too difficult for us. A quick search on the internet revealed that it was a non-circular trail with rope bridges that took about four hours and did not seem particularly safe. Instead, we headed towards a restored resort town from ancient Japan, where we had a delicious lunch of noodles with vegetarian tempura and chicken.

After lunch, we took a hike in the forest of wild birds, where we saw many stuffed animals inside a birdhouse. Our next stop was the Wind Cave, which had a historical significance. The ice blocks in the cave used to be harvested and sold to preserve food during the shogunate period.

We arrived at the cave and discovered that we needed 600 yen to visit both the wind and ice caves, but we only had 400 yen in cash, and the nearest ATM was 4 km away. Fortunately, a group of young men helped us with the remaining 300 yen. Inside the cave, we saw beautiful ice columns and blocks, which were fascinating.

As we were leaving the cave, we almost missed the bus back. We waited for an hour and decided to pass the time by buying cookies in the shape of Mount Fuji and practicing balance exercises at the station.

Lesson learned: always carry enough cash, as some places may not accept credit cards or have ATMs nearby.

Overall, our day in Fujikawaguchiko was filled with exciting adventures and beautiful sights. If you plan to visit the area, I recommend bringing a good pair of hiking shoes, a warm jacket, and a reliable map or GPS. Additionally, purchasing a portable charger for your phone or camera could be helpful, as some areas may have limited access to power sources.

In conclusion, Fujikawaguchiko is an excellent destination for nature and history lovers. With its stunning mountains, picturesque lakes, and fascinating historical sites, it offers a unique and unforgettable experience.
